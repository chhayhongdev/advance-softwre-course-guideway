# Module 0: Software Development Methodologies

## Overview
This module introduces essential software development methodologies, practices, and tools that form the foundation for modern software engineering, particularly in the context of microservices development. Students will learn about traditional and agile approaches, DevOps culture, version control, and quality assurance practices.

## Topics

### Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- **Traditional Models:**
  - Waterfall model: A linear, sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment) must be completed before moving to the next. Best for projects with stable, well-defined requirements, but inflexible to changes.
  - Spiral model: Combines iterative development with risk assessment. Each cycle involves planning, risk analysis, engineering, and evaluation, allowing for incremental refinement and early risk mitigation.
  - V-Model: Extends the waterfall model by adding verification and validation activities at each stage, ensuring quality checks are built into the process from the beginning.
- **Agile Methodology:**
  - Core principles: Emphasizes people and collaboration over rigid processes, delivering working software frequently, adapting to change, and prioritizing customer needs. This approach values flexibility and responsiveness over comprehensive upfront planning.
  - Manifesto values and their implications: The 12 principles guide teams to embrace change, deliver value incrementally, and foster sustainable development practices that lead to better software and happier teams.
- **Benefits of Iterative Development:**
  - Early feedback and adaptability: Allows stakeholders to see progress early and provide input, enabling course corrections before significant resources are invested.
  - Reduced risk through incremental delivery: Breaking work into smaller chunks minimizes the impact of failures and allows for continuous validation.
  - Improved stakeholder engagement: Regular demonstrations and interactions keep everyone aligned and informed throughout the project.
  - Faster time-to-market: Delivering working software in short cycles allows for quicker realization of business value.

### Agile Frameworks
- **Scrum:**
  - Roles: Product Owner manages the product backlog and prioritizes features; Scrum Master facilitates the process and removes impediments; Development Team self-organizes to deliver the work.
  - Ceremonies: Sprint Planning defines what to build and how; Daily Scrum provides quick status updates; Sprint Review demonstrates completed work; Sprint Retrospective reflects on improvements.
  - Artifacts: Product Backlog is the living list of all potential work; Sprint Backlog contains items committed for the current sprint; Increment is the sum of all completed backlog items.
  - Time-boxed sprints and empirical process control: Fixed-length iterations (typically 2-4 weeks) with regular inspection and adaptation based on actual progress and feedback.
- **Kanban:**
  - Visualizing workflow with Kanban boards: Uses columns to represent stages of work (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done), making bottlenecks and progress visible at a glance.
  - Work In Progress (WIP) limits to prevent bottlenecks: Restricts the number of tasks in each stage to maintain flow and identify constraints early.
  - Pull system and continuous flow: Work is pulled into the next stage only when capacity allows, promoting sustainable pace and quality.
  - Metrics: Lead time measures total time from request to delivery; cycle time tracks active work duration; throughput indicates completed items per period.
- **Extreme Programming (XP):**
  - Pair programming and collective code ownership: Two developers work together on one workstation, and any team member can modify any part of the code, promoting knowledge sharing.
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices: Writing automated tests before implementing code ensures requirements are met and prevents regressions.
  - Continuous integration and refactoring: Frequent code merges and improvements maintain code health and prevent technical debt accumulation.
  - User stories and acceptance criteria: Simple descriptions of features from the user's perspective, with clear conditions for completion.

### DevOps Principles
- **Culture, Automation, Measurement, Sharing (CALMS):**
  - Breaking down silos between development and operations: Encourages cross-functional teams where developers and operations staff collaborate throughout the entire software lifecycle.
  - Collaboration and shared responsibility: Everyone takes ownership of quality, reliability, and performance, fostering a "we" mentality over "us vs. them."
- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):**
  - Automated build, test, and deployment pipelines: Code changes trigger automatic processes that compile, test, and deploy software, reducing manual errors and speeding up delivery.
  - Tools: Jenkins for automation orchestration, GitLab CI for integrated pipelines, GitHub Actions for cloud-based workflows that integrate with repositories.
  - Benefits: Faster releases with automated quality checks, reduced errors from manual processes, and improved software quality through frequent testing.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**
  - Managing infrastructure through code (e.g., Terraform, Ansible): Treats infrastructure provisioning, configuration, and management as software development, enabling version control and automation.
  - Version control for infrastructure changes: Track and audit infrastructure modifications just like code changes, improving reliability and rollback capabilities.
  - Immutable infrastructure and declarative configurations: Define desired state rather than imperative steps, allowing for consistent, repeatable deployments.

### Version Control and Collaboration
- **Git Fundamentals:**
  - Repository initialization and cloning: Creating a new local repository with `git init` or copying an existing one with `git clone` to start tracking project history.
  - Basic commands: `git add` stages changes, `git commit` saves them permanently, `git push` uploads to remote, `git pull` downloads updates.
  - Branching strategies: Feature branches isolate new work, release branches prepare stable versions, hotfixes address critical bugs in production.
  - Merging and resolving conflicts: Combining branches with `git merge` or `git rebase`, and manually fixing overlapping changes when they occur.
  - Pull requests and code review workflows: Proposing changes through PRs allows team review before merging, ensuring quality and knowledge sharing.
- **Collaborative Development:**
  - Using GitHub/GitLab for remote repositories: Cloud platforms provide hosting, issue tracking, and collaboration features beyond basic Git.
  - Forking and contributing to open-source projects: Creating personal copies to experiment, then submitting changes via pull requests to contribute back.
  - Branch protection rules and merge strategies: Preventing direct pushes to main branches and requiring reviews, with options like squash or rebase merges.
- **Code Reviews and Best Practices:**
  - Conducting effective code reviews: Focus on clarity, correctness, and maintainability rather than style preferences, providing constructive feedback.
  - Code review checklists and guidelines: Standardized criteria for consistency, covering functionality, security, performance, and documentation.
  - Pair programming and mob programming techniques: Real-time collaboration where two (pair) or multiple (mob) developers work together, sharing knowledge instantly.
  - Documentation and knowledge sharing: Maintaining READMEs, wikis, and conducting knowledge transfer sessions to build team capabilities.

### Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Testing Levels:**
  - Unit testing: Testing individual functions or classes in isolation to verify they work as expected, often using mocks for dependencies.
  - Integration testing: Testing how different components work together, such as API calls between services or database interactions.
  - System testing: End-to-end testing of the complete application in an environment that mimics production, validating overall behavior.
  - Acceptance testing: Validating that the software meets business requirements and user needs, often involving stakeholders or automated acceptance tests.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):**
  - Red-Green-Refactor cycle: Write a failing test (red), implement minimal code to pass it (green), then improve the code while keeping tests passing (refactor).
  - Writing tests before code: Forces thinking about requirements and design upfront, resulting in more testable and maintainable code.
  - Benefits for code quality and maintainability: Catches bugs early, serves as documentation, and provides confidence for refactoring.
- **Automated Testing Strategies:**
  - Continuous testing in CI/CD pipelines: Running tests automatically on every code change to catch issues before they reach production.
  - Test automation frameworks (JUnit, TestNG, Selenium): Tools for writing and executing tests, with JUnit for Java unit tests, Selenium for web UI testing.
  - Mocking and stubbing for isolated testing: Replacing real dependencies with fake objects to test components independently and control test scenarios.
- **Code Quality Tools and Metrics:**
  - Static analysis tools (SonarQube, ESLint): Analyze code without running it to detect bugs, security vulnerabilities, and style issues.
  - Code coverage metrics: Measuring what percentage of code is executed by tests, aiming for high coverage to ensure thorough testing.
  - Complexity metrics and technical debt: Tracking code complexity (cyclomatic complexity) and accumulating maintenance costs from suboptimal code.
  - Performance benchmarking: Measuring application performance under load to identify bottlenecks and ensure scalability.
